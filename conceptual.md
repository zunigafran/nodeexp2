### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

- What is a JWT?
  * JWT is JSON Web Token.

- What is the signature portion of the JWT?  What does it do?
  * It is a signature in the header, payload, and a secret key. When the toekin is received, the server can use the same algorithm and secret key to verify that the token has not been tampared with.

- If a JWT is intercepted, can the attacker see what's inside the payload?
  * Yes unless it is encrypted because otherwise it can easily be decoded.
  
- How can you implement authentication with a JWT?  Describe how it works at a high level.
  * When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT containing user information and signs it. The server sends this JWT to the client. The client includes the JWT in the headers of subsequent requests. The server, upon receiving a request, verifies the JWT's signature and extracts user information from the payload to authenticate and authorize the user.
  
- Compare and contrast unit, integration and end-to-end tests.
  * Unit tests focus on individual components or functions, ensuring they work as expected in isolation. Integration tests check how different components work together. End-to-end tests evaluate the entire application's functionality from start to finish, simulating real user scenarios.

- What is a mock? What are some things you would mock?
  * A mock is a simulated object or function used in testing to mimic real components. In testing, there are different things that mock such as external services, databases, or complex functions to isolate the code being tested and control the environment so that the tests are more predicatable and focused. 

- What is continuous integration?
  * Continuous integration is a software development practice where the code changes are automatically tested and integrated into a shared repostiory multiple times. It is to detect and address integration issues early in the development process.

- What is an environment variable and what are they used for?
  * it is an environment varible that has a dynamic-named value that can affect the behavior of running processes. They are used to store configuration settings, such as database connection strings or API keys outside of the application code.

- What is TDD? What are some benefits and drawbacks?
  * aka Test-Driven Development which is an approach where tests ar ewritten before the actual code. It improves code quality, better maintainability, and early bug detection. An issues with it, is that is time overhead to write the tests and the challenge of writing comprehensive tests for complex systems.
  
- What is the value of using JSONSchema for validation?
  * It is a standardized way to describe the structure of JSON data. By using JSONSchema for validation ensure that data adheres to a specific format, making it easier to enforce data consistency and catch errors early in the development process.
  
- What are some ways to decide which code to test?
  * Application functionality, error-prone sections, and frequently changing components.

- What does `RETURNING` do in SQL? When would you use it?
  * It used in SQL to return values generated by an SQL statement, such as the result of an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operation. It's useful when you want to retrieve specific information about the affected rows after the execution of the SQL statement.

- What are some differences between Web Sockets and HTTP?
  * Web Sockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection, suitable for real-time applications. HTTP, on the other hand, is a stateless protocol where each request establishes a new connection. Web Sockets are generally more efficient for real-time and bidirectional communication.

- Did you prefer using Flask over Express? Why or why not (there is no right
  answer here --- we want to see how you think about technology)?
  * I did because I was able to render the app easily. With Express, I am going to practice with it more beucase it can be powerful with the right conditions.
